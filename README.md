# Quizmaster 2018
## Introduction
This application is a quiz that you can control with either button pressing or by using your voice. 
## Technical aspects
The application uses two databases. One for the question data and the other for tracking the scores of the players. If you want to control the quiz with your voice, you can just read out the text that is written inside the buttons. It is possible that the application will not understand at the first try, so repeat yourself multiple times if it does not seem to understand you.
## Starting Page
The starting page gives you one of several choices. The first option leads you directly to the main page / the quiz. The second option links to the highscore page. The third option lets you close the application. At the bottom left, you will get information read out to you, by the voice of Zira of Microsoft. At the bottom right, you can add a question and possible answers to the quiz.
